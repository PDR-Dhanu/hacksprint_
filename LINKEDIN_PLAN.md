### 🚀 Day 2/30: Laying the Foundation - UI & State Management

Today was all about setting up a solid foundation. A great app needs a robust structure and a delightful UI.

**🔧 Core UI & Framework Decisions:**
*   **Next.js 15 App Router:** For server-first components, performance, and clean routing.
*   **Shadcn/UI & Tailwind CSS:** Why? Speed and consistency. Shadcn gives me beautifully designed, accessible components that I can own and customize. Tailwind CSS keeps styling fast and maintainable.
*   **Global State with React Context:** To simulate a backend, I've set up a global `HackathonProvider`. This context acts as our single source of truth for all app data—users, teams, projects, etc. It uses a reducer for predictable state transitions, making it a powerful pattern for managing complex client-side data.

**✅ Today's Wins:**
*   Initialized the Next.js project and configured the theme in `globals.css`.
*   Built the main `RootLayout` with `ThemeProvider` for light/dark mode.
*   Created the `HackathonProvider` to manage all application state.
*   Set up a multi-tenant system with a "College Selector" component, allowing the entire app context to switch based on the selected institution.

This setup ensures that from day one, we have a scalable and maintainable frontend architecture. The app feels fast, looks clean, and is ready for the complex features ahead.

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Building the core user authentication flow (simulated) and designing the separate portals for Students, Judges, and Admins.

#NextJS #Shadcn #TailwindCSS #React #Frontend #BuildInPublic

---

### 🚀 Day 3/30: User Authentication & Role-Based Portals

Authentication is the gateway to any application. Today, I built out the complete (simulated) auth system for HackSprint's three distinct user roles.

**🔑 Feature Breakdown:**
*   **Multi-Role Login:** Created separate login flows for Students and Judges/Admins. A single entry point for Judges and Admins simplifies the experience for faculty who might wear both hats.
*   **Client-Side Auth Logic:** All auth logic is handled through the `HackathonProvider` and the `hackathon-api.ts` file, which mimics calls to a real backend like Firebase Auth. It handles registration, login, and error states.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Once a user logs in, the global context updates with their role (`currentUser`, `currentJudge`, `currentAdmin`). The UI then conditionally renders the correct portal and navigation, ensuring users only see what they're supposed to.
*   **Pending/Approved States:** New student registrations are set to a 'pending' status, requiring admin approval—a critical feature for private college hackathons.

This role-based architecture is key to providing a tailored experience for each user type, which is central to HackSprint's vision.

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Deep dive into the Admin Dashboard, focusing on the user approval system and judge management.

### 🚀 Day 4/30: The Admin Dashboard - Command Center

The Admin Dashboard is the central nervous system of HackSprint. Today, I built the user management and approval features.

**✅ Key Admin Features Implemented:**
*   **Pending Approvals:** A dedicated section where admins can see a list of all students awaiting registration approval. With one click, they can approve a student, which updates their status globally and unlocks their access.
*   **User & Judge Lists:** Clear, scrollable lists of all approved students and registered judges, with the ability to remove users if needed.
*   **Direct Registration:** Admins can bypass the approval queue by directly adding a student or judge with a temporary password, perfect for on-the-spot registrations.
*   **Responsive Layout:** The dashboard is built on a responsive grid, ensuring admins can manage the event from their desktop or a tablet on the go.

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Implementing the Announcement system, allowing admins to broadcast real-time updates to all participants.

#AdminPanel #Dashboard #UIUX #NextJS #BuildInPublic

---

### 🚀 Day 5/30: Real-Time Announcements

Communication is key during a fast-paced hackathon. Today, I built the Announcements feature.

**📢 Feature Highlights:**
*   **Admin Broadcast:** Admins can post announcements that appear in a real-time feed for all users.
*   **Scheduled & Expiring Posts:** I added the ability to set a "publish at" and "expires at" date and time. This allows admins to queue up announcements in advance (e.g., "Hacking ends in 1 hour!") and have them automatically disappear after the event.
*   **Notification System:** A subtle bell icon in the header now indicates unread announcements, ensuring no one misses a critical update.

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Shifting focus to the Student Portal to build the team creation and joining flow.

#Realtime #Feature #NextJS #BuildInPublic

### 🚀 Day 6/30: Student Portal - Team Management

Hackathons are all about teamwork. Today, I built the core of team collaboration in HackSprint.

**🤝 Team Features:**
*   **Create a Team:** Students can create a new team for a selected hackathon. Upon creation, a unique 6-character join code is generated.
*   **Join with a Code:** Students can use this code to request to join an existing team.
*   **Request & Approval Flow:** Team creators see a list of incoming join requests and can either accept or reject them. This prevents unwanted members from joining.
*   **Team Hub:** Once on a team, students land in a dedicated "Team Hub" showing their members, join code, and a real-time chat.

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Introducing the first major AI feature: the AI Teammate Finder.

#Collaboration #StudentExperience #NextJS #BuildInPublic

---

### 🚀 Day 7/30: AI Feature #1 - The Teammate Matchmaker

Finding the right team is half the battle. Today, I integrated an AI Teammate Matchmaker! It analyzes user profiles to suggest the most compatible partners.

**🤖 How It Works:**
*   **Data Collection:** The AI relies on the data students provide in their profiles—specifically their `skills` (e.g., 'React', 'Python') and `workStyle` tags (e.g., 'Late-night coder', 'Strong presenter').
*   **Genkit Flow:** A flow named `find-teammate-matches.ts` takes the current user's profile and a list of all other available students as input.
*   **Zod Schemas:** The input and output are strictly typed using Zod. `FindTeammateMatchesInputSchema` defines the shape of the incoming data, and `FindTeammateMatchesOutputSchema` defines the expected list of matches, each with a user profile, a `compatibilityScore`, and a `reasoning` string.
*   **AI Prompting:** The prompt instructs the Gemini model to act as an expert team builder, focusing on two things: **skill complementarity** (finding users with skills the current user lacks) and **work style harmony**.
*   **Output:** The AI returns a sorted list of the top 3-5 matches, each with a score and a concise explanation for why they're a good fit (e.g., "Their backend skills in Python complement your frontend React expertise.").

This feature turns a stressful process into a data-driven, intelligent search for the perfect collaborator.

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Building the rich user profile page where students add the skills and tags that power the matchmaker.

#Genkit #AI #Zod #BuildInPublic

---

### 🚀 Day 8/30: Enhancing Profiles for Better Matching

The AI Matchmaker is only as good as the data it has. Today was about building the UI for students to create rich, detailed profiles.

**👤 Profile Page Features:**
*   **Editable Fields:** Students can update their name, bio, and add links to their GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.
*   **Skill Tagging:** I created a dynamic tagging system using `Badge` components from Shadcn. Students can select from a predefined list of `SKILL_TAGS` (from `src/lib/constants.ts`) covering languages, frameworks, and non-technical skills.
*   **Work Style Selection:** Similarly, students can choose from a list of `WORK_STYLE_TAGS` to describe how they like to work.
*   **Completion Prompt:** If a user's profile is missing skills or work styles, a prominent prompt appears, guiding them to complete it to unlock the AI Matchmaker.

This structured data is key for the AI to make meaningful recommendations and is a great example of how UI design directly impacts the effectiveness of AI features.

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Starting the project submission journey with another AI feature: the Idea Generator.

#UIUX #React #UserProfile #BuildInPublic

---

### 🚀 Day 9/30: AI Feature #2 - The Idea Generator

Writer's block, but for hacking. Today, I built an AI Idea Generator to help teams that are stuck for inspiration.

**💡 How it Works:**
1.  **Theme Suggestions:** A student first inputs a broad interest (e.g., "AI in Healthcare"). A Genkit flow (`ai-project-idea-suggestions.ts`) takes this query and returns three relevant, high-level themes (e.g., "AI for Diagnostics," "Mental Health Tech").
2.  **Idea Generation:** The student can then click a button on their chosen theme. This triggers a second flow (`generate-project-idea.ts`) which takes the theme and generates a more concrete project idea, complete with a creative title and a one-sentence description.
3.  **UI Integration:** The entire experience is built into the project submission form. Suggested themes are displayed in a `Carousel` component, and the final idea appears in a `Card`, ready to be used.

This two-step process helps narrow down the creative process, making it less overwhelming and guiding students toward a tangible starting point.

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Building the project submission form itself, where teams officially enter the competition.

#AIFeatures #Genkit #Hackathon #BuildInPublic

---

### 🚀 Day 10/30: The Project Submission Form

With an idea in hand, it's time to submit. Today, I built the project submission form where teams officially enter the competition.

**📝 Form Features:**
*   **Core Fields:** The form captures the Project Name, Description, and a mandatory GitHub Repository URL.
*   **State Management:** All form state is handled using `useState` hooks. On submission, the `submitProject` function from `hackathon-api.ts` is called.
*   **Optimistic UI:** When a project is submitted, the UI immediately switches to the "Project View" component, even before the data is fully saved. This makes the app feel incredibly fast and responsive.
*   **AI Image Generation (Background):** On successful submission, a server action (`generateProjectImageAction`) is triggered in the background. It calls a Genkit flow that uses Imagen (Google's image model) to create an abstract hero image based on the project's name and description. This image URL is then updated in the project's data record.

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Developing the "Project View" where teams can see their submitted project and access more powerful AI tools.

#Forms #React #NextJS #BuildInPublic

---

### 🚀 Day 11/30: AI Feature #3 - AI Code Review

What if you could get feedback *before* judging? Today, I've integrated an AI Code Reviewer directly into the Project View.

**🔍 How It Works:**
*   **Trigger:** Students click a "Get AI Feedback" button next to their submitted project.
*   **Genkit Flow:** This calls the `aiCodeReviewForSubmissions` flow, passing it the project's GitHub URL.
*   **AI Analysis:** The prompt instructs the Gemini model to act as an AI code review assistant. It's prompted to analyze the repository for code quality, identify potential issues, and suggest improvements.
*   **Plain Text Output:** A key constraint in the prompt is that the entire review must be returned in plain text (no markdown). This makes it easy to render in a simple `<pre>` tag, preserving formatting like line breaks without complex parsing.
*   **UI Display:** The review appears in a `Card` component, providing instant, actionable feedback to the students.

This feature democratizes mentorship, giving every team access to high-level feedback on demand.

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Building the AI Pitch Coach, which will help teams structure their final presentation.

#CodeReview #AI #Genkit #BuildInPublic

---

### 🚀 Day 12/30: AI Feature #4 - AI Pitch Coach (Outline)

A great project needs a great pitch. The new AI Pitch Coach generates a 5-slide presentation outline based on the project's details.

**🎤 How It Works:**
*   **Genkit Flow:** The `generatePitchOutline` flow takes the project's name, description, and (optionally) the AI code review as input for additional context.
*   **Structured Output:** Using a Zod schema (`GeneratePitchOutlineOutputSchema`), the AI is instructed to return a JSON object containing an array of `slides`. Each slide object has a `title` and `content` (formatted as markdown bullet points).
*   **Standard Structure:** The prompt enforces a classic 5-slide structure: 1. Introduction, 2. The Problem, 3. Our Solution, 4. Impact & Future, 5. Q&A. This gives teams a proven formula for a successful pitch.
*   **UI Display:** The generated outline is displayed in an `Accordion` component, with each slide as a collapsible section.

This feature removes the guesswork from creating a presentation, giving teams a professional structure to build upon.

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Adding a groundbreaking TTS voiceover feature to the Pitch Coach.

#Presentation #Pitching #AIFeatures #BuildInPublic

---

### 🚀 Day 13/30: AI Feature #5 - Pitch Audio with TTS

This is cool. After generating a pitch outline, users can now click 'Generate Audio.' I built a flow that uses Gemini's TTS model to create a full audio voiceover of the pitch.

**🔊 TTS Implementation Details:**
*   **Genkit Flow:** The `generatePitchAudio` flow takes the raw text of the pitch script.
*   **Model Call:** It calls the `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts` model, specifying `responseModalities: ['AUDIO']` and a prebuilt voice ('Algenib').
*   **The Conversion Problem:** The TTS model returns audio in raw PCM format, which browsers can't play.
*   **The `wav` Solution:** I added the `wav` npm package. The flow takes the Base64 PCM data from the model, decodes it into a Buffer, and then uses a `wav.Writer` to wrap it in the proper headers to create a valid WAV file structure.
*   **Data URI:** The final WAV data is re-encoded into Base64 and returned to the client as a data URI (`data:audio/wav;base64,...`). This self-contained URI is then plugged directly into an HTML5 `<audio>` element's `src` attribute.

It's a game-changer for practicing timing and delivery!

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Finalizing the student-facing AI tools by adding AI-generated project images.

### 🚀 Day 14/30: AI Feature #6 - AI Project Image Generation

Every project deserves a unique identity. Today, I finished the feature that uses Imagen 4, Google's image generation model, to create an abstract hero image for each project.

**🎨 Image Generation Flow:**
*   **Trigger:** This is automatically triggered in the background when a team first submits their project.
*   **Genkit Flow:** The `generateProjectImageFlow` is called with the project's name and description.
*   **The Prompt:** The prompt is carefully crafted to ask for a "visually stunning, iconic, and abstract representation" of the project. It explicitly tells the model *not* to be literal and to focus on a style of "digital art, vibrant colors, and cinematic lighting."
*   **Data URI Return:** The Imagen model returns the generated image as a data URI.
*   **Updating Firestore:** The `submitProject` API function, after creating the project document, calls this flow asynchronously. Once the image URL is returned, it updates the `imageUrl` field on the project's document in Firestore.

These images will be displayed in the public project gallery, giving each project a unique visual flair.

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Building that public Project Showcase page where these images will shine.

#ImageGeneration #AI #Genkit #BuildInPublic

---

### 🚀 Day 15/30: The Public Project Showcase

Celebrating the work! Today, I created the Project Showcase, a public gallery of all submitted projects for a given hackathon.

**🖼️ Showcase Features:**
*   **Dynamic Filtering:** A dropdown menu allows any visitor to select a hackathon and view its specific projects.
*   **AI-Generated Images:** Each project is displayed on a `Card` component, prominently featuring the AI-generated `imageUrl` as a header image.
*   **Interactive Cards:** On hover, the card reveals an overlay with a button linking directly to the project's GitHub repository.
*   **Responsive Grid:** The gallery is built with a responsive CSS grid that adapts from a single column on mobile to three columns on desktop.
*   **Staggered Animation:** I used `framer-motion` to apply a subtle staggered "slide-in" animation to the cards as they load, making the gallery feel more dynamic.

This page is a tribute to the participants' hard work and a central place to see the fruits of their labor.

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Shifting gears to the Judging Portal to build the project evaluation experience.

#NextJS #UIUX #Gallery #BuildInPublic

### 🚀 Day 16/30: The Judging Portal - A Centralized Hub

Fairness and efficiency are crucial for judging. I built the foundation for the Judging Portal today.

**⚖️ Portal Features:**
*   **Hackathon Selection:** Like other parts of the app, judges first select the hackathon they are judging from a dropdown.
*   **Project List:** The portal displays a list of all submitted projects for that event.
*   **Scoring Status:** Each project in the list clearly indicates whether the currently logged-in judge has already scored it, using a green "Scored" badge. This helps judges track their progress.
*   **Navigation:** Clicking "Score Project" or "Edit Score" navigates the judge to the detailed scoring form for that specific project.

This centralized view ensures judges can easily manage their workload and see exactly what needs to be done.

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Building the detailed scoring form itself, with a dynamic rubric.

#Judging #Admin #WebApp #BuildInPublic

---

### 🚀 Day 17/30: The Scoring Form & Rubric

I've built the detailed scoring form. Judges can now score projects against a predefined rubric.

**📝 Scoring Form Deep Dive:**
*   **Dynamic Rubric:** The form is built from a constant (`JUDGING_RUBRIC` in `src/lib/constants.ts`). This array defines each criterion (e.g., 'Innovation'), its ID, and its max score. This makes the rubric easy to modify in one place.
*   **Team vs. Individual Scoring:** I implemented two separate rubrics. The main rubric scores the project as a whole. A second, `INDIVIDUAL_JUDGING_RUBRIC`, is rendered inside an accordion for each team member, allowing judges to score individual contributions.
*   **Interactive Sliders:** For each criterion, I used Shadcn's `Slider` component, which provides a much better user experience than a simple input field.
*   **State Management:** All scores and comments are held in a single state object: `scores: { [targetId]: { [criteriaId]: value } }`. The `targetId` is either 'team' or a member's unique ID, making the data structure clean and scalable.

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Integrating AI assistance directly into the scoring form to help judges make faster, more informed decisions.

#Forms #React #UI #BuildInPublic

---

### 🚀 Day 18/30: AI Feature #7 - AI Project Summaries for Judges

To save judges time, I added an 'AI Summary' button to the scoring form.

**🧠 How It Works:**
*   **Trigger:** A judge clicks the "Generate AI Project Summary" button at the top of the scoring form for a project.
*   **Genkit Flow:** This calls the `generateProjectSummary` flow, passing it the project's name, description, and GitHub URL.
*   **Focused Prompt:** The prompt for this flow is very specific. It instructs the AI model to act as an assistant for judges and generate a 3-4 sentence summary covering:
    1.  The core problem solved.
    2.  The main functionality.
    3.  The potential impact.
*   **Quick Context:** The concise summary is then displayed in a `Card`, giving the judge immediate context on the project's goals before they dive into the code or presentation details.

This small feature has a huge impact on efficiency, allowing judges to get through more projects with less cognitive load.

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Giving judges access to the same AI Pitch Coach tools that the students used.

#AIforGood #Productivity #Genkit #BuildInPublic

---

### 🚀 Day 19/30: Judge Access to AI Pitch Coach

Judges now have access to the same AI Pitch Coach tools as students.

**👨‍⚖️ How it Benefits Judges:**
*   **Context on Presentation:** From the scoring form, judges can now generate the project's 5-slide pitch outline. This shows them how the team structured their narrative and if they clearly communicated their ideas.
*   **Listen to the Pitch:** They can also generate and listen to the TTS audio voiceover. This is incredibly useful for understanding the intended tone, pacing, and emphasis of the team's presentation, especially for remote or asynchronous judging.
*   **Fairness:** It provides a level playing field, as judges can see the exact same AI-generated materials that the students had available to them.

This feature bridges the gap between the code and the presentation, giving judges a more holistic view of the team's work.

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Developing the real-time Leaderboard to bring a competitive spark to the event.

#FeatureFriday #UIUX #HackathonLife #BuildInPublic

---

### 🚀 Day 20/30: The Live Leaderboard

Competition meets transparency. Today, I built the live Leaderboard.

**🏆 Leaderboard Logic:**
*   **Client-Side Calculation:** The leaderboard data is calculated entirely on the client side using a `useMemo` hook. This hook listens for changes to the `projects` array in the global state.
*   **Data Processing:**
    1.  It filters for projects that have at least one score.
    2.  It sorts these projects in descending order based on their `averageScore`.
    3.  It maps the sorted data into a clean `LeaderboardEntry` object, adding the team name and rank.
*   **Podium Finish:** The top 3 entries are sliced from the array and rendered in special "Podium" `Card` components, with unique styling for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place.
*   **Top 10 Table:** The rest of the top 10 are displayed in a clean, responsive `Table` component.

Because all data is synced in real-time through the `HackathonProvider`, the leaderboard updates instantly as judges submit new scores.

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Building the Final Results page where the winners are officially announced.

#ReactHooks #DataVisualization #Realtime #BuildInPublic

---

### 🚀 Day 21/30: Announcing the Winners - The Results Page

The grand finale! I created the Results page, which officially announces the top 3 winners.

**🎉 Results Page Features:**
*   **Celebratory UI:** The page is designed to feel like an event. It features a prominent "Final Results" title and uses the same "Podium Card" components from the leaderboard to feature the top 3 winners.
*   **Confetti Animation:** To make it special, I built a lightweight confetti animation using CSS. The `useEffect` hook triggers the generation of 150 `<div>` elements, each with randomized positions, colors, and animation delays, creating a rain of confetti over the page.
*   **Download Certificates:** Each winner's card includes a "Download Certificate of Achievement" button, which will be the trigger for our next feature.

This page provides a definitive and celebratory conclusion to the hackathon.

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Implementing the PDF certificate generation logic.

#UIUX #Animation #CSS #BuildInPublic

---

### 🚀 Day 22/30: PDF Certificate Generation

Making achievements official. I implemented PDF certificate generation using `jsPDF` and `qrcode`.

**📜 How It Works:**
*   **Utility Function:** All logic is encapsulated in a `generateCertificate` function in `src/lib/pdf.ts`.
*   **jsPDF Library:** This function uses `jsPDF` to programmatically construct the certificate. It sets the page orientation, adds text with specific fonts and sizes, and draws shapes and lines for the border.
*   **Dynamic Content:** It takes the team name, project name, members, and score as arguments to populate the certificate dynamically.
*   **QR Code Generation:** The `qrcode` library is used to generate a QR code from a verification URL (`/verify/[projectId]`). This QR code is converted to a Data URI and added to the PDF using `doc.addImage()`.
*   **Conditional Templates:** The function has two separate internal templates: one for winners (with rank and gold styling) and one for general participation, ensuring the right certificate is generated based on the team's rank.

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Building the public certificate verification page that the QR code links to.

#jsPDF #JavaScript #Frontend #BuildInPublic

---

### 🚀 Day 23/30: The Public Certificate Verification Page

Trust and verification are key. I built a dynamic verification page at `/verify/[projectId]`.

**✅ How Verification Works:**
*   **Dynamic Route:** The page uses Next.js's dynamic routing. The `[projectId]` in the URL is captured using the `useParams` hook.
*   **URL Parameters:** The QR code URL includes the college ID as a query parameter (e.g., `?college=VJIT`). This is crucial for the multi-tenant system to know which database to query.
*   **Client-Side Fetching:** On page load, a `useEffect` hook runs. It takes the `projectId` and `collegeId` and fetches the corresponding project and team documents directly from Firebase using `getDoc`.
*   **Displaying Data:** If the documents are found, the page displays the verified details: project name, team name, final score, and the list of awarded members. If not, it shows a "Verification Failed" message.

This feature closes the loop on certification, making every achievement verifiable and preventing fraud.

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Starting a new major feature set: the Support Ticket system for students.

#NextJS #Firebase #Security #BuildInPublic

---

### 🚀 Day 24/30: The Student Support Ticket System

Every user needs help sometimes. I created the Support page where students can submit a ticket with their questions.

**🎫 Submission Form:**
*   **Simple UI:** The form is straightforward, containing fields for a `subject`, the `question`, and an optional dropdown to associate the ticket with a specific hackathon.
*   **Authentication Guard:** The page is only accessible to logged-in students. If a user is not logged in, it shows a message prompting them to do so.
*   **API Call:** On submission, it calls the `submitSupportTicket` function in the API.
*   **Success Feedback:** After a successful submission, the form clears and displays a confirmation message with the new Ticket ID, which the student can use to track their request.

This is the first step in building an advanced, AI-assisted support workflow.

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Integrating AI to automatically triage and categorize incoming support tickets.

#Support #CustomerExperience #React #BuildInPublic

---

### 🚀 Day 25/30: AI Feature #8 - AI Support Ticket Triage

To help admins, I built an AI triage system. When a student submits a ticket, a Genkit flow automatically processes it.

**🤖 Triage Flow (`triage-support-ticket.ts`):**
*   **Trigger:** The `submitSupportTicket` API function calls this flow before saving the ticket.
*   **Input:** The flow receives the student's name, the ticket subject, and the question.
*   **Categorization & Prioritization:** The prompt instructs the AI to analyze the ticket and determine two things based on predefined rules:
    1.  `category`: 'Technical Issue', 'Rule Clarification', 'Team Dispute', etc.
    2.  `priority`: 'Low', 'Medium', or 'High'. (Team disputes are always High priority).
*   **Suggested Response:** The AI also drafts a polite, templated initial response acknowledging the student's question and letting them know an admin will look into it.
*   **Data Enrichment:** The category, priority, and suggested response are added to the ticket object before it's saved to the database.

This saves admins a huge amount of time by organizing and prioritizing their work for them.

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Building the support dashboard where admins will see these triaged tickets.

#AI #Automation #Support #BuildInPublic

### 🚀 Day 26/30: The Admin Support Dashboard

I built the admin-facing Support Dashboard today. It provides a powerful interface for managing incoming tickets.

** Kanban-Style Board:**
*   **Columns:** The dashboard is designed as a Kanban board with three columns: 'New', 'In Progress', and 'Resolved'.
*   **Drag-and-Drop (Simulated):** Admins can manage ticket status using a dropdown on each card. In a more advanced version, this could be a full drag-and-drop interface.
*   **Ticket Cards:** Each ticket is represented by a `Card` component that displays all essential information at a glance:
    *   Subject and question.
    *   Student's name.
    *   AI-triaged `category` and `priority` (with color-coded badges).
    *   The AI's suggested first response.
*   **Automatic Status Updates:** I added logic where tickets automatically move from 'New' to 'In Progress' after 24 hours, and to 'Resolved' after 72 hours, ensuring nothing gets missed.

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Adding AI-powered response generation to help admins resolve tickets even faster.

#Dashboard #Admin #Kanban #BuildInPublic

### 🚀 Day 27/30: AI Feature #9 - AI-Drafted Support Responses

Closing the loop on support. Admins can now click 'Use AI to Draft Response' on a ticket.

**✍️ How It Works:**
*   **UI Trigger:** A button in the ticket reply dialog triggers the `generateSupportResponse` server action.
*   **Genkit Flow:** The flow receives the ticket's subject, the student's question, and the AI-pre-triaged category.
*   **Contextual Prompt:** The prompt instructs the AI to act as an expert support agent for HackSprint. It uses the context to craft a comprehensive, empathetic, and step-by-step resolution.
*   **Markdown Output:** The AI is asked to format its response in Markdown. This allows for clear formatting like lists, bold text, and code blocks.
*   **Editable Response:** The generated Markdown is populated into a `Textarea`. The admin can then review, edit, and personalize the response before sending it to the student.

This feature turns a 10-minute task into a 1-minute review, dramatically improving admin efficiency.

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Building the data export and analytics features for admins.

#AI #SupportAgent #GenAI #BuildInPublic

### 🚀 Day 28/30: Admin Analytics & Data Export

Data is power. I built the Analytics tab in the Admin Dashboard.

**📊 Dashboard Features:**
*   **Charts with Recharts:** I used the `recharts` library to create two key visualizations:
    1.  **Average Scores by Criteria:** A `BarChart` that shows the average score for each judging criterion (Innovation, UI/UX, etc.) across all projects in a hackathon. This helps organizers understand what skills were strongest.
    2.  **Project Score Breakdown:** A `RadarChart` that visualizes the score distribution for a single, selected project, making it easy to see its strengths and weaknesses.
*   **Data Export to CSV:** I added "Export Submissions" and "Export Participants" buttons.
    *   **Logic:** These buttons trigger client-side functions that take the relevant data (projects or users), convert it into a CSV-formatted string, and then create a temporary `Blob` and `<a>` link to trigger a file download in the browser.

These features provide valuable insights for post-event analysis and reporting.

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Implementing the final AI feature: automated hackathon summary reports.

### 🚀 Day 29/30: AI Feature #10 - Automated Hackathon Summary Report

The final AI feature is here! Admins can now generate a complete, automated summary report for any hackathon.

**📄 Report Generation Flow:**
*   **Trigger:** An admin clicks "Generate Hackathon Report" on the Reports tab.
*   **Data Aggregation:** The action gathers all relevant data for the selected hackathon: the hackathon details, all projects, and all teams.
*   **Genkit Flow:** This data is passed to the `generateHackathonReport` flow. Before calling the prompt, the flow pre-processes the data, sorting projects by score to identify the winners.
*   **Comprehensive Prompt:** The prompt is extensive. It receives the hackathon stats and the ranked list of projects, and is instructed to generate a professional Markdown report with specific sections:
    1.  Executive Summary
    2.  Key Statistics
    3.  Winning Teams
    4.  Project Highlights & Trends
    5.  Conclusion
*   **Markdown Rendering:** The returned Markdown string is rendered directly in the UI using the `marked` library, providing a beautifully formatted report that's ready to be shared with stakeholders.
*   **PDF Export:** I also added a "Download as PDF" button that uses `jsPDF` to convert the report into a downloadable PDF document.

**🔮 Tomorrow’s Plan:** Final review, QA, and preparing for the "launch" of the completed project.

### 🚀 Day 30/30: Final Review & Project Showcase

Day 30! I've completed the full build of HackSprint. Today was spent doing a final QA pass, fixing responsiveness issues, and polishing the UI.

**✅ Final Checklist:**
*   **Responsiveness:** Tested every page on mobile, tablet, and desktop views to ensure layouts are clean and functional. Fixed issues with form layouts and navigation on smaller screens.
*   **UI Polish:** Made minor adjustments to spacing, alignment, and color consistency across the entire application. Ensured all interactive elements have clear hover and focus states.
*   **Bug Hunt:** Clicked through every user flow for all three roles (Admin, Judge, Student) to catch any lingering bugs or awkward interactions.
*   **Code Cleanup:** Removed console logs, added comments where necessary, and formatted the codebase.

The result is a feature-complete, AI-powered platform ready to manage hackathons. Thank you for following along on this #BuildInPublic journey! It has been an incredible experience sharing my process with you all.

**🚀 What's Next?**
*   **Live Demo:** A link to the live, deployed application.
*   **GitHub Repo:** A link to the full source code for you to explore.
